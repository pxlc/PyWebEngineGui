## Version 1.9.0 (2019-07-23)

* Add the FORCE_QT_API environment variable to keep using the Qt
  bindings selected with the QT_API variable and avoid switching

  applications that import PySide and PyQt bindings at the same
  time (which is possible if both bindings are compiled for the
  same Qt version).
